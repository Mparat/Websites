	<div id="gameInfo" align="left"><p>I worked with MakeGameWithUs in the summer of 2013 to develop a unique iPhone game and publish it to the App store. Similar to Tap Tap Revenge, or Dance Dance Revolution, the main idea is to tap on the buttons the instance the falling objects collide with them. Every level has a twist to it, though (ie. in Level 22, you must tap the spiders to kill them before they reach the buttons or else you automatically lose). The penguin falls either ways depending on which side you miss the button click, and he will eventually fall over and you will lose the game. Version 1 is expected to be up on the store in early 2014. Features:
		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
				<li>28 Levels</li>
				<li>Point system</li>
				<li>Star system; to be earned and/or bought to use to skip levels</li>
				<li>Music</li>
				<li>A hint to the altered rules of each level</li>
		</ul> </p></div>

	<div id="appInfo" align="left"><p>Following Malcom Gladwell's 10,000-Hour-Rule, the 10,000 Hours mobile app is designed to motivate and assist users to pursue their hobbies to perfection, thus leading to success. The basic idea is to run the timer while doing a certain task or activity that you wish to keep track of how much time you spend doing, and your time will be saved between quitting and reopening the app. For example, athletes may run this app every time they put time into their sport (ie. going to practice or working out). Features:
		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
				<li>Log multiple activities</li>
				<li>Display of 5-10 hours at a time</li>
				<li>Custom goals for hour increments, with reminders</li>
				<li>Progress bar</li>
				<li>Accesses your calendar and alerts you of large chunks of free time in your day to work on your activity</li>
		</ul> 
		Expected on the App store in 2014.
